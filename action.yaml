outputs:
  failure-reason:
    description: |
      When the job outcome is `failure` because the validation failed, this will be set to 'validate-failed'.
      If the job fails for any other reason this will not be set.
      This can be used with the Actions expression syntax to conditionally run a step when the validate fails.
